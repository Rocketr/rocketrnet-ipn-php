# IPN Notification Payload
After you enable IPN Notifications for your products and have successfully setup IPN Notifications on your website, you will receive a post request every time a buyer has purchased a product and paid for the product in its entirety. 

To verify the integrity of the payload, we will send an HMAC signature over a HTTP header called "IPN_HASH". The HMAC signature will be a signed json encoded POST object with your IPN secret. You can see how to verify the signature in the `example_rocketr_ipn.php` file in this repository.

We will send the following information in the post request as a JSON Object:
 - order_id
   * This is a unique string of 12 characters that identifies each order.
 - product_title
   * This the product title for which the IPN is being sent.
 - product_id
   * This the product id for which the IPN is being sent.
 - buyer_email
   * The email address of the buyer.
 - buyer_ip
   * The IP Address of the buyer (note this can be in IPv4 or IPv6 format)
 - payment_method
   * This is a number that represents the payment method used for the purchase:
      * 0 = Paypal
      * 1 = Bitcoin
      * 2 = Ethereum
      * 3 = Perfect Money
      * 4 = Stripe 
      * 5 = PayPal (new system)
      * 6 = Bitcoin Cash
 - invoice_amount_usd
   * This is a decimal value of the amount the buyer was invoiced (and the amount the buyer paid in USD)
 - quantity
   * The number of items the buyer purchased.
 - purchased_at
   * A MySQL DateTime object signifying the time the invoice was generated (formatted as Y-m-d H:i:s)
 - txn_id
   * This is a string that represents a transaction id for the payment method used to purchase the product. For example, this can refer to payapl's transaction id, btc/eth's blockchain ID, or perfect money id
 - status
   * This is an integer value that refers to the order status. Please see sample code for more information.
 - custom_fields
   * This contains all the custom fields that may have been associated with the order. 
   * You can use custom fields to, for example, ask the buyer for their account username/id/email associated with an account on your website
